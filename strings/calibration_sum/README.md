# Calibration sum

Given a list of strings, combine the first and last digit of each string
into a two-digit number and return the sum of all of them.

- A string with a single digit uses it as both first and last digit.
- A string with no digits adds nothing.

## Approach
Two indices scan each string, one from the left and one from the right,
until each finds a digit. The two digits are joined, converted to int
and added to the total.

## Example
Input: 1abc2, pqr3stu8vwx, a1b2c3d4e5f, treb7uchet
Output: 142
